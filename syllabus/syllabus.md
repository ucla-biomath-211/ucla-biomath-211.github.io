### Course Topics

This is a tentative list of topics:  

* Linear regression (review) (5%)  
* Logistic regression (15%)  
* Count data and poisson regression (15%)  
* Multinomial data (5%)

### Prerequisite

The prerequisite for this course is linear algebra (Biostat 200A, 200B and linear algebra at level of [BIOSTAT 216](https://ucla-biostat216-2019fall.github.io/schedule.html)). Those wishing to enroll without these prerequisites will need to obtain consent from the instructor.  Homework will use the statistical programming computing language [R](https://www.r-project.org).

### Course Materials

Required book (freely available via UCLA library):  

* Julian Faraway, _Extending the Linear Model with R_, 2nd Edition, CRC Press (2016), [UCLA library link](https://catalog.library.ucla.edu/vwebv/holdingsInfo?searchId=1577&recCount=50&recPointer=2&bibId=8877916) 

Following book is recommended but not required: 

* Annette Dobson and Adrian Barnett, _An Introducton to Generalized Linear Models_, 4th Edition, CRC Press (2018), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Generalized-Chapman-Statistical-Science/dp/1138741515/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=an+INTROduction+TO+GENERALIZED+LINEAR+MODELS&qid=1585366195&sr=8-1)  

### Attendance

I usually require class attendence. Given the COVID-19 pandemic, I understand students may not be able to attend certain lectures due to medical or technical reasons. Please proactively communicate with the instructor and TA and notify us your circumstances at earliest chance. 

### Homework

You will be required to work on 7-8 homework assignments throughout the quarter.  

### Exam

There is a midterm exam (time TBD) and a final exam .

### Final Grade

Grades will be based on homework (30%), midterm (30%), final exam (30%), and class participation (lecture/office hour attendence and questions) (10%). 

### UCLA ADA Policy 

Students needing academic accommodation based on a disability should contact the Center for Accessible Education (CAE) at (310)825-1501 or in person at Murphy Hall A255. When possible, students should contact the CAE within the first two weeks of the term as reasonable notice is needed to coordinate accommodations.

### Inclusivity

UCLA’s Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion provides resources, events, and information about current initiatives at UCLA to support equality for all members of the UCLA community. I hope that you will communicate with me or your TA if you experience anything in this course that does not support an inclusive environment, and you can also report any incidents you may witness or experience on campus to the Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion on their website <https://equity.ucla.edu>.


### Academic Integrity

**Message about Academic Integrity to All UCLA Students from UCLA Dean of Students**: UCLA is a community of scholars. In this community, all members including faculty staff and students alike are responsible for maintaining standards of academic honesty. As a student and member of the University community, you are here to get an education and are, therefore, expected to demonstrate integrity in your academic endeavors. You are evaluated on your own merits. Cheating, plagiarism, collaborative work, multiple submissions without the permission of the professor, or other kinds of academic dishonesty are considered unacceptable behavior and will result in formal disciplinary proceedings usually resulting in suspension or dismissal.

**Forms of Academic Dishonesty**: As specified in the UCLA Student Conduct Code, violations or attempted violations of academic dishonesty include, but are not limited to, cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, multiple submissions or facilitating academic integrity:   
• Allowing another person to take a quiz, exam, or similar evalution for you  
• Using unauthorized material, information, or study aids in any academic exercise or examination – textbook, notes, formula list, calculators, etc.  
• Unauthorized collaboration in providing or requesting assistance, such as sharing information   
• Unauthorized use of someone else’s data in completing a computer exercise  
• Altering a graded exam or assignment and requesting that I be regraded

**Plagiarism**: Presenting another’s words or ideas as if they were one’s own  
• Submitting as your own through purchase or otherwise, part of or an entire work produced verbatim by someone else  
• Paraphrasing ideas, data or writing without properly acknowledging the source  
• Unauthorized transfer and use of someone else’s computer file as your own  
• Unauthorized use of someone else’s data in completing a computer exercise  

**Multiple Submissions**: Submitting the same work (with exact or similar content) in more than one class without permission from the instructor to do so. This includes courses you are currently taking, as well as courses you might take in another quarter.

**Facilitating Academic Dishonesty**: Participating in any action that compromises the integrity of the academic standards of the University; assisting another to commit an act of academic dishonesty   
• Taking a quiz, exam, or similar evaluation in place of another person   
• Allowing another student to copy from you  
• Providing material or other information to another student with knowledge that such assistance could be used in any of the violations stated above (e.g., giving test information to students in other discussion sections of the same course)  
• Altering data to support research  
• Presenting results from research that was not performed  
• Crediting source material that was not used for  research  

While you are here at UCLA, if you are unsure whether what you are considering doing is cheating, **don’t take chances** – ask your professor. In addition, avoid placing yourself in situations which might lead your professor to **suspect you of cheating**.

**Alternatives to Academic Dishonesty**

• Seek out help – Meet with your professor, ask for assistance as needed.  
• Ask for an extension – if you explain your situation to your professor, she/he might be able to grant you an extended deadline for an upcoming assignment.  
•	See a counselor at Student Psychological Services, and/or your school, college or department – UCLA has many resources for students who are feeling the stresses of academic and personal pressures.
